# Image-Caption-Generator
Image Caption Generator project focuses on creating a Neural Network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

## Project: Image Captioning

The Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset is a large-scale dataset for scene understanding. The dataset is commonly used to train and benchmark object detection, segmentation, and captioning algorithms.
